# airbnb-clone-project
This project is about cloning the main features of airbnb to help in identifying and solving real world problems.
The goal is to understand the backend infrastructure of airbnb and build efficient systems.
The program will help me upskill from intermediate to a more proficient developer rwith Djangoand relevant technologies.

# Team Roles
**Backend Developer:**
Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, build applications from the ground up or assist front-end teams, and business logic.
**Database Administrator:** 
Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
**DevOps Engineer:**
Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
**QA Engineer:**
Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Technology Stack
**Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
**Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
**PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
**GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
**Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
**Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
**Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
**CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Database Design
**Users:**
Name, Properties, Property, Location
**Properties:**
Locationc, Cost, Assistant
**Bookings:**
Date, Property, Amount, User
**Reviews:**
Date, User, Comment
**Payments:**
Amount, Propert, Payment method

# Feature Breakdown
**User Management:** Secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
**Property Management:** Features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
**Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
**Payment Processing:** Payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
**Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
**Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# API Security
**Authentication**
Measure: Use secure, token-based authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0) to verify the identity of users or systems accessing the API.
Importance:
User Data Protection: Prevents unauthorized access to personal and sensitive user information.
Account Integrity: Ensures only legitimate users can access their own data and services.

**Authorization**
Measure: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to enforce fine-grained permissions.
Importance:
Business Logic Enforcement: Ensures users can only perform actions allowed by their role (e.g., admin vs. customer).
Data Security: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they do not own or manage.

**Rate Limiting and Throttling**
Measure: Set request limits per user or IP using tools like Redis-backed rate limiters.
Importance:
Service Stability: Prevents abuse through excessive or automated requests (DDoS protection).
Resource Optimization: Preserves system performance for all users.

**Input Validation and Sanitization**
Measure: Validate all input data and sanitize to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS).
Importance:
Database Protection: Blocks malicious data from compromising the backend.
System Integrity: Prevents users from injecting scripts or commands that could harm the server.

**HTTPS and Data Encryption**
Measure: Enforce HTTPS and encrypt data at rest and in transit using SSL/TLS and AES.
Importance:
Privacy: Protects data from being intercepted during communication.
Compliance: Meets legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
