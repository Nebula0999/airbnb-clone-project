# airbnb-clone-project
This project is about cloning the main features of airbnb to help in identifying and solving real world problems.
The goal is to understand the backend infrastructure of airbnb and build efficient systems.
The program will help me upskill from intermediate to a more proficient developer rwith Djangoand relevant technologies.

# Team Roles
**Backend Developer:**
Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, build applications from the ground up or assist front-end teams, and business logic.
**Database Administrator:** 
Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
**DevOps Engineer:**
Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
**QA Engineer:**
Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Technology Stack
**Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
**Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
**PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
**GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
**Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
**Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
**Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
**CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Database Design
**Users:**
Name, Properties, Property, Location
**Properties:**
Locationc, Cost, Assistant
**Bookings:**
Date, Property, Amount, User
**Reviews:**
Date, User, Comment
**Payments:**
Amount, Propert, Payment method

# Feature Breakdown
**User Management:** Secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
**Property Management:** Features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
**Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
**Payment Processing:** Payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
**Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
**Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# API Security
**Authentication**
Measure: Use secure, token-based authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0) to verify the identity of users or systems accessing the API.
Importance:
User Data Protection: Prevents unauthorized access to personal and sensitive user information.
Account Integrity: Ensures only legitimate users can access their own data and services.

**Authorization**
Measure: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to enforce fine-grained permissions.
Importance:
Business Logic Enforcement: Ensures users can only perform actions allowed by their role (e.g., admin vs. customer).
Data Security: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they do not own or manage.

**Rate Limiting and Throttling**
Measure: Set request limits per user or IP using tools like Redis-backed rate limiters.
Importance:
Service Stability: Prevents abuse through excessive or automated requests (DDoS protection).
Resource Optimization: Preserves system performance for all users.

**Input Validation and Sanitization**
Measure: Validate all input data and sanitize to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS).
Importance:
Database Protection: Blocks malicious data from compromising the backend.
System Integrity: Prevents users from injecting scripts or commands that could harm the server.

**HTTPS and Data Encryption**
Measure: Enforce HTTPS and encrypt data at rest and in transit using SSL/TLS and AES.
Importance:
Privacy: Protects data from being intercepted during communication.
Compliance: Meets legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

# CI/CD Pipeline
**What Are CI/CD Pipelines?**
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. A CI/CD pipeline is an automated process that helps developers build, test, and deploy code changes more efficiently and reliably.
**Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically integrates and tests code changes as they are pushed to the repository.
**Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD):** Automatically deploys tested code to staging or production environments.
**Importance**
Faster Development Cycle: Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployment, speeding up the release of new features.
Improved Code Quality: Automatically runs tests and checks, catching bugs early before they reach production.
Consistent Deployments: Ensures code is deployed in a repeatable and reliable manner, reducing human error.
Team Collaboration: Allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without breaking the main codebase.
Customer Satisfaction: Enables quicker updates and bug fixes, improving user experience and trust.
**Tools**
GitHub Actions: Automates CI/CD workflows directly within GitHub repositories.
Docker: Packages applications and dependencies into containers for consistent environments from development to production.
Jenkins: A widely used open-source CI server with extensive plugin support.
GitLab CI/CD: Built-in CI/CD system within GitLab repositories.
CircleCI or Travis CI: Cloud-based CI/CD tools that integrate easily with GitHub.
Kubernetes: Used in CD for deploying and scaling containerized applications.
